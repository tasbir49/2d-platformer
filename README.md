## Background
I made this project at the latter half of 2016. 
The gist of this project is that it is a Mario clone. 
I intended for this project to be as close as possible to
Super Mario Bros for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
The project was originally done for my grade 12 computer
science course. We were allowed to make any game we wanted.
Now I originally wanted to do something far simpler like
a 2D space shooter. However I always wanted to try making
something this complex and this project was the perfect
oppurtunity to do so.

## Coding
- Coded in Java using the IntelliJ IDE
- Used Swing Library to generate the graphics
- The sprites for most of the non animated objects were accessed through a tileset
- For animation, the spritesheets I used did not have a consistent layout that I could see. 
I ended up splitting each individual frame into it's own file. I do see that there is a consistent layout now
- This project required us to use the technology that our class went over. Since our class did not cover generics,
I resorted to making a linked list class for each entity(this was very annoying to do).
